                        <p>Hi, I'm Yachin, user experience (UX) designer and creator of UX Challenge.</p>
                        <p>Like many designers, I'm constantly looking for opportunities to sharpen my skills, and sometimes it takes the form of a <span className="bold">"fake redesign"</span> of those popular websites or apps â€” like Instagram.</p>
                        <p>It makes for a fun project, <span className="bold">but everyone knows it's fake</span>, including our potential employers or clients.</p> 
                        <p>Wouldn't it be better if we use our problem solving and design skills to make a real difference? Like, <span className="bold">helping a nonprofit organization with their website or app idea?</span></p>
                        <p><span className="bold">This is why I created UX Challenge</span>, a way for nonprofit organizations to get various design recommendations for their unique problems, and for designers to expand their portfolios with real world case studies.</p>
